												<h4>Öga</h4>
												<p>Öga is a Virtual Reality game, an experience of survival horror, psychological horror and action genres.
													The player has to defend his home from the attack of cultists and beasts that emerge from deep in the forest.
													During the day the player collects materials (wood, metal and gunpowder) around the house and deep in the forest to create weapons and items to block doors and windows. 
													During the night he must resist the waves of different enemies that attack the house, trying to enter and kill him
												.</p>
												<p>This game was selected, along with 7 other projects, by ADVA (argentine videogame association) to win a 6 month mentorship, during those months we received training by an experienced person in the industry. At the end of the mentoring we were the team that had the most progress and polishing, therefore we won the first place.</p>

												<h4>Froiland</h4>
												<p>This was a project that I made through a course to learn the basics of unreal engine. In this first approach I learned how collisions work, widgets, animation state machines, sound events and even behavior trees, different senses for the AI.</p>
